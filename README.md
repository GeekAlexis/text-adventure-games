## Descriptions for my game
The game takes place in a modern urban setting and the goal is for the player to get to the grocery store. There are 4 locations and one puzzle embedded in the game.
The player should feel free to explore and interact with non-player characters in order to solve the puzzle.
The caped man character in the game is inspired by One Punch Man. I chose to design the character that way to make the puzzle interesting.
